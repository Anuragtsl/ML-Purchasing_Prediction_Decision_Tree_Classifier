# ML-Purchasing_Prediction_Decision_Tree_Classifier

I have created Machine Learning Model With Decison Tree Classifier for Customer's Purchasing Predictions.

In this I've used Python’s Famous libraries like [Numpy](), [Pandas](), and [Sklearn]() for Preparing Data and Model Development.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook]() for coding!

# Project Overview

Let’s look at the dataset. To make it interesting, let’s assume these are records of customers who purchased or did not purchase an iPhone.

The sample rows are shown above. 

**Our goal in this project is to predict if the customer will purchase an iPhone or not given their gender, age and salary.**
